Ran the exercise but my output was weird:
1: 'O'
1: 'U'
1: 'Y'
2: t is not a vowel
3: 'A'
4: t is not a vowel
5: 'O'
5: 'U'

see how it pulled vowels not in the word? that's odd . . .    
UPDATE: I forgot breaks
Book reads, "Use uninitialized values in the switch" What does that mean?
    not getting that
