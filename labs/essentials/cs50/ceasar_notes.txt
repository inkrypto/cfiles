Ci=(Pi + K) % 26
plaintext A + 2 = C
ascii 65 + 2 = 67

alphabet 0 + 2 = 2

'A' treats as an it
('A'+2)%26 = (65+2)%26
=67%26=15
Use the formula above on to alphabet index
	(0+2)%26 = 2%26 = 2 
	C = 2i

for every letter in secret, find which index it is in alphabet[]

test:
./caesar 13
plaintext:  hello, world
ciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq
