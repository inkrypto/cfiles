ex14.c:32-35 De necan_print_it,whichsimplyreturnsthetruthvalue(0or1)ofisalpha(ch) || isblank(ch) back to its caller, print_letters.

1. why are isalpha and isblank not initialized?

how come the author just didn't do
"isalpha == 1 || isblank == 1"


2. I received this error when I had char **argv on line 8:
"ex14xtr.c: At top level:
ex14xtr.c:30:5: error: conflicting types for ‘can_print_it’
 int can_print_it(char ch)"

adding the *argv[] fixed it.

3. Last bullet on how to break it, need help
❯ gcc -Wall -g ex14xtr.c -o ex14xtr
ex14xtr.c: In function ‘main’:
ex14xtr.c:37:25: error: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer nor vector
     print_arguments(argc[1], argv);
                         ^

4. Extra credit 1, use ext14xtr to example

5. look at the difference between xtr and xtr2. see that there is no number on xtr2, why

6. Extra credit 2, look at 14
Do this with David

7.teststrlen.c 
    void print_letters(char arg[], int length) 
    for (i = 0; i < length; i++) {
where does length get initialized and does it contain strlen?
